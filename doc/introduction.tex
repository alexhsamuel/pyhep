\chapter{Introduction}

This tutorial presents a tour of \pyhep's most important features, and
shows how to perform some common tasks.  We assume you are familiar with
modern versions of the Python language, at least version 2.2.  

\pyhep makes use of several newer Python features, such as true division
and list comprehensions.  While you don't strictly need to be familiar
with these features to use \pyhep, some of them will help you use \pyhep
to its greatest advantage.  In particular, \pyhep is designed to support
a functional programming style, which is well-suited for many common HEP
computing tasks.  Many advanced Python features support functional
programming: the \function{map}, \function{reduce}, and
\function{filter} built-in functions; iterators; \code{lambda}
expressions; generators; and list comprehensions.
